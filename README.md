# LukaSQL

Basic Sports Project where I used SQL to draw some conclusions on teamwork and player impact.
1. Started by web scraping individual statistics and team statistics from Basketball Reference
2. Used subtraction to clean the data for games he did not play and games where his minutes were less than average
